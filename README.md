### The Race

* First off, this is going to be fun!  You will certainly have anxieties about
  rest and pulling off the runs but it will be easier than you think, and well
  worth the experience.  Both Mike and I have had very positive experiences
  running Ragnar, feel free to ask us any questions.

* 12 runners, 200ish total miles.  Everyone runs 3 legs totaling between 12.4
  and 21.8 miles.  We run through the night, so expect that 1 of your legs will
  be during dawn to dusk hours.  You will have support from the van along the
  route (see details below how it works), however, if you do not want to run
  alone at night, another runner can run with you and that "buddy" runner will be
  allowed to skip one of his/her legs.  We will start Friday morning (start
  time determined by our average predicted 10k pace), and it will take till
  early afternoon Saturday to finish.  

* The 12 sets of 3 legs are predetermined. Of course, we are free to assign
  whomever we like to each set.  E.g. the set with the shortest total distance
  is runner 12 with 3.8mi, 4.5mi, and 4.1mi legs and the longest is runner 10
  with 8.1mi, 9.7mi and 4mi.  Mike and I will take the hardest sets, and we
  will assign based on preferences.  You can see the course and the legs
  for each runner here:
  https://www.runragnar.com/event-detail/relay/reachthebeach#course

* Don't stress about being able to pull off the runs.  The 5hrs or so of rest
  you get in between your legs is plenty to recharge.  In your training, if you
  can work up to 12mi of running per week, say 3 runs of 3mi, 3mi, and 6mi, you
  will be plenty prepared.  We're not trying to win any trophies, if you have
  to walk, then walk.  There is a 12 week training program and a 4 week crash
  course [here](https://www.runragnar.com/training/road?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-o-_ytDN-AIVKilMCh2sygOEEAAYASAAEgK54_D_BwE)

* The 12 runners are split into 2 sets of 6. Runners 1-6 in van 1, and 7-12 in
  van 2.  Runners 1-6 start and run all their runs consecutively while van 2 is
  on break and travels to the runner 6 to 7 transition point.  Then van 2 takes
  over, runners 7-12 run while van 1 is on break and travels to the next
  transition point.  You do this a total of 3 times.  When your van is on
  break, you will have time to grab a meal and catch some sleep.

* When a van is "on", they will drop their 1st runner off at the start of their
  leg, then drive to the next runners transition point.  They may stop at 1 or
  2 places along the way to cheer on the current runner and provide support
  (water, food, check to make sure runner is ok).  

## Logistics

* The finish line will be home base for us.  I've rented two beach houses in
  Seabrook, NH, (Thursday night through Sunday night).  One will align with van
  1 and the other with van 2.  Plan to arrive Thursday midday.  Van 1 will have to
  get up early Friday morning and drive 2hrs to the starting line.  That may
  mean a wakeup time of 4-5am, so try to be well rested before you arrive in
  town.  Van 2 will likely have to leave by 8am to meet van 1 at the first
  transition point.  

* For those who are flying, your options are Logan, Boston (1hr away), or MHT,
  Manchester (30min away).  You will likely have better flight options flying
  into Logan, and there is a Bus [(C&J Buslines)](https://www.ridecj.com/) that
  will take you direct from Logan to Seabrook for $24.  The bus runs every
  hour, leaving Logan at 10 past the hour.   I will pick you up in Seabrook.    I
  can also pick you up in Manchester if that airport works out better.   

* The two vans are 12-15 passenger vans and we will need multiple drivers for each
  van.  Since Mike and I have experience with Ragnar, I figure that we will
  each take van captain of a van.  When we pick up the vans on Thursday, we'll get
  1 or 2 others on the driving roster at Enterprise.  

## Packing Items

* The main thing(s) that you may not have lying around at home are lights and
  reflective vests.  Each person will need a front light and a rear red
  blinking light.  You will also need a reflective vest, because you cannot get
  out of the van during sundown hours (something like 7pm to 7am) without wearing
  one.  We do have some extra lights and vests, so if you don't want to
  purchase those things for this event, hopefully we can cover you.  

* You should also bring a sleeping bag and optionally a pillow.  A sleeping pad
  will be helpful as well.  We also may have extras if you do not want to
  travel with these items.  

* It's not required, but encouraged to run with your cell phone, at least
  during the nighttime leg.  If you don't like to carry your phone when you
  run, consider a carrier or clothing that has pockets for carrying your phone
  without it bouncing around.  I sometimes run in cycling jerseys and use the
  rear pockets. 

* With 6 sweaty people in the van it can get ripe.  It can also be hard to stay
  organized living out of a bag, in a van, for 36 hrs.  One good way we've
  found to manage that is to pack 3 sets of running clothes into freezer bag size
  ziplocks.  As soon as you are done with your leg, change, put the dirty
  clothes into the ziplock and seal.  

* More packing items forthcoming as we get closer 

## FAQ

1.  How do we sleep?  

First I will say that sleep was a big worry for me when I did Ragnar the first
time, but it turned out not to be a big deal.  Mike had the same experience.
You should try to get quick naps in the van while we are traveling.  Bringing
ear plugs will help with this.  During the extended breaks, i.e. when your van
is "off", we will typically park somewhere to get some extended sleep.  This
may mean lying out in a field on your sleeping bag.  I bring a hammock which
can work well.  There is a member of our run club who offers her house during
the nighttime van transition point.  Hopefully she will be able to do that for
us because our run club doesn't seem to be running Ragnar this year.  We will
be able to take showers and sleep in quiet on beds or couches.
