## JHU "Cut Throats" Ragnar Team 

### Latest updates:


9/11
* It looks like we'll be going with 11 runners.  Me, Mike W, and Jason will each be taking an extra leg.
    * Runner 1: Ghost (Marc leg 1, Mike W leg 2, Jason + Marc leg 3) 
    * Runner 2: Adriana
    * Runner 3: Jason
    * Runner 4: Juri
    * Runner 5: Tim
    * Runner 6: Marc
    * Runner 7: Mike C
    * Runner 8: Sal
    * Runner 9: Chris
    * Runner 10: Mike W
    * Runner 11: Amy
    * Runner 12: Ed
* Address for houses are: 317 Ashland St. and 282 Portsmouth Ave. Seabrook NH.
  I don't know yet which van will take which house.  We might want to mix it up
  and not assign along van boundaries, since we will likely want to spend some
  time with folks who aren't in our van.  The houses are only 3 blocks from one
  another. 
* Our official start time is 7:45am.  Van 1 should shoot to be there by 7am,
  which means a leave time at 4:30am from Seabrook.  
* Van 2 will need to be at the 1st transition point (Attitash Ski Area) by
  11:15am, which means an 8:30am leave time from Seabrook. 
* If you haven't come across it yet, take a look at the "runner's packet"
  [here](https://quip.com/dUAHAaimgopS).  I've listed the important points
  below. 
* Does everyone have 2 front and rear lights and reflective vest? 
* **important** You will receive an email about online check-in and completing
  an online safety video on **Monday**.  You have to get this done (I think
they give you 24hrs or something), otherwise you will have to come to the start
of the race and watch the video before we start.  This would be especially bad
for anyone in van 2.  
* There is no support for legs 9 and 10.  That means that your van will **not**
  be able to pull over during the race and cheer you on or give you water
  during those legs.  If this is a problem 
* We will not be able to transition to van 2 if we arrive at the 1st transition
  point before 11:15.  AND, we if that happens, runner 7 won't be able to start
  until 11:45.  It is highly like that that will happen because our average pace
  is probably faster than what we registered as.  It is probably best to
  sandbag so that we don't have to wait until 11:45.  
* Van 1 can not arrive at the 2nd transition point (Kenneth Brett School)
  before 4:30pm.  In the past we've been able to park on the road nearby, but
  they want you to go to white lake state park. Instead.   
* I will need to get a reasonable average pace for your legs.  I'll be putting
  together a spreadsheet with expected arrival times, so that vans can get
  accurate estimates of arrival times.  We will update the spreadsheet in real
  time with actual arrival times. 

9/6
* We now have 11 on our roster with a strong maybe as a 12th 
* Our official start time is 7:45am Friday

### The Race

* First off, this is going to be fun!  You will certainly have anxieties about
  rest and pulling off the runs but it will be easier than you think, and well
  worth the experience.  Both Mike and I have had very positive experiences
  running Ragnar, feel free to ask us any questions.

* 12 runners, 200ish total miles.  Everyone runs 3 legs totaling between 12.4
  and 21.8 miles.  We run through the night, so expect that 1 of your legs will
  be during dusk to dawn hours.  You will have support from the van along the
  route (see details below how it works), however, if you do not want to run
  alone at night, another runner can run with you and that "buddy" runner will be
  allowed to skip one of his/her legs.  We will start Friday morning (start
  time determined by our average predicted 10k pace), and it will take till
  early afternoon Saturday to finish.  

* The 12 sets of 3 legs are predetermined. Of course, we are free to assign
  whomever we like to each set.  E.g. the set with the shortest total distance
  is runner 12 with 3.8mi, 4.5mi, and 4.1mi legs and the longest is runner 10
  with 8.1mi, 9.7mi and 4mi.  Mike and I will take the hardest sets, and we
  will assign based on preferences.  You can see the course and the legs
  for each runner here:
  https://www.runragnar.com/event-detail/relay/reachthebeach#course

* Don't stress about being able to pull off the runs.  The 5hrs or so of rest
  you get in between your legs is plenty to recharge.  In your training, if you
  can work up to 12mi of running per week, say 3 runs of 3mi, 3mi, and 6mi, you
  will be plenty prepared.  We're not trying to win any trophies, if you have
  to walk, then walk.  There is a 12 week training program and a 4 week crash
  course [here](https://www.runragnar.com/training/road?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-o-_ytDN-AIVKilMCh2sygOEEAAYASAAEgK54_D_BwE)

* The 12 runners are split into 2 sets of 6. Runners 1-6 in van 1, and 7-12 in
  van 2.  Runners 1-6 start and run all their runs consecutively while van 2 is
  on break and travels to the runner 6 to 7 transition point.  Then van 2 takes
  over, runners 7-12 run while van 1 is on break and travels to the next
  transition point.  You do this a total of 3 times.  When your van is on
  break, you will have time to grab a meal and catch some sleep, factoring in 
  that it will take about an hour to drive to the next transition point. 

* When a van is "on", they will drop their 1st runner off at the start of their
  leg, then drive to the next runners transition point.  They may stop at 1 or
  2 places along the way to cheer on the current runner and provide support
  (water, food, check to make sure runner is ok).  

## Logistics

* The finish line will be home base for us.  I've rented two beach houses in
  Seabrook, NH, (Thursday night through Sunday night).  One will align with van
  1 and the other with van 2.  Plan to arrive Thursday midday.  Van 1 will have to
  get up early Friday morning and drive 2hrs to the starting line.  That may
  mean a wakeup time of 4-5am, so try to be well rested before you arrive in
  town.  Van 2 will likely have to leave by 8am to meet van 1 at the first
  transition point.  

* For those who are flying, your options are Logan, Boston (1hr away), or MHT,
  Manchester (30min away).  You will likely have better flight options flying
  into Logan, and there is a Bus [(C&J Buslines)](https://www.ridecj.com/) that
  will take you direct from Logan to Seabrook for $24.  The bus runs every
  hour, leaving Logan at 10 past the hour.   I will pick you up in Seabrook.    I
  can also pick you up in Manchester if that airport works out better.   

* The two vans are 12-15 passenger vans and we will need multiple drivers for each
  van.  Since Mike and I have experience with Ragnar, I figure that we will
  each captain a van.  When we pick up the vans on Thursday, we'll get 1 or 2
  others on the driving roster at Enterprise.  

## Packing Items

* The main thing(s) that you may not have lying around at home are lights and
  reflective vests.  Each person will need **Two** front lights and **Two** rear red
  blinking light.  You will also need a reflective vest, because you cannot get
  out of the van during sundown hours (something like 7pm to 7am) without wearing
  one.  We do have some extra lights and vests, so if you don't want to
  purchase those things for this event, hopefully we can cover you.  

* You should also bring a sleeping bag and optionally a pillow.  A sleeping pad
  will be helpful as well.  We also may have extras if you do not want to
  travel with these items.  

* It's not required, but encouraged to run with your cell phone, at least
  during the nighttime leg.  If you don't like to carry your phone when you
  run, consider a carrier or clothing that has pockets for carrying your phone
  without it bouncing around.  I sometimes run in cycling jerseys and use the
  rear pockets. 

* With 6 sweaty people in the van it can get ripe.  It can also be hard to stay
  organized living out of a bag, in a van, for 36 hrs.  One good way we've
  found to manage that is to pack 3 sets of running clothes into freezer bag size
  ziplocks.  As soon as you are done with your leg, change, put the dirty
  clothes into the ziplock and seal.  

* Suggested packing items.  Try to pack light if you can, this will be dictated somewhat by the weather.
    ### Running Equipment
    * Running shoes (suggest two pair)
    * Cool weather running gear -- night legs may be cold
    * Warm weather running gear
    * Running socks (pair for each leg)
    * Running hat
    * Water carrier/ water bottle if you need it.  Keep in mind that the van can be available along the way to support and provide water/snacks, etc. 
    * Watch
    * 2 x (Headlamp + rear red blinker)
    * Reflective vest
    * Sunscreen
    * Bug repellent
    * Water
    ### Non-running Equipment
    * Two changes of dry clothing
    * flip-flops or sandals
    * socks
    * warm socks
    * light jacket, hoodie, sweats, hat and gloves/mittens (for hanging around, sleeping at night)
    * sleeping bag or blanket
    * large zip lock bags -- for sweaty clothes
    * Money
    * Food (non-perishables are best.  We can decide to stock each van together.  There will be enough food along the way for meals, so mostly snack items.  Don't stress out about being fueled, you don't want to suddenly change your diet because you think you need to fuel up.  Things like english muffins and peanut butter, granola bars, etc.)
    * Cell phone
    * Medications
    * Body wipes (nice for wiping down since we can't shower.  We can probably get these per van)
    * Tooth brush and tooth paste
    * Deodorant
    * Small towels
    * Blister pats or athletic tape for blister repair
    * First-aid kit (one per van)
    * Toilet paper
    * Power converter and chargers for cellphones and GPS

## Cost

* Total will be about $500 per person, which includes lodging for
  Thursday-Sunday nights.  $148.16 per person for the race, $245 per person for
  the beach house, and then somewhere between $85-$100 for the van rental.  

## FAQ

1.  How do we sleep?  

    First I will say that sleep was a big worry for me when I did Ragnar the first
    time, but it turned out not to be a big deal.  Mike had the same experience.
    You should try to get quick naps in the van while we are traveling.  Bringing
    ear plugs will help with this.  During the extended breaks, i.e. when your van
    is "off", we will typically park somewhere to get some extended sleep.  This
    may mean lying out in a field on your sleeping bag.  I bring a hammock which
    can work well.  There is a member of our run club who offers her house during
    the nighttime van transition point.  Hopefully she will be able to do that for
    us because our run club doesn't seem to be running Ragnar this year.  We will
    be able to take showers and sleep in quiet on beds or couches.
